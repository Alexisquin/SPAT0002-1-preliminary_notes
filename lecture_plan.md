## Part 1: Programming

### 1.0 Avant-propos

Dominique's note: we should make clear to the students that we know that did not pick astrophysics
because they like programming more than anything else ðŸ˜‰ ... but we want to stress that programming
is an important tool of research nowadays and for that reason, mastering good tools helps being more
efficient ! I could also explain my "case" ... learning by myself, have "misconduct" attitude in
programming ... and slowly learning how to improve. Most importantly I have improved work efficiency
AND ambition as I discovered a large variety of libraries, tools, ... that are freely available !

**TODO: send mail + Poll to estimate students knowledge [nothing, beginner, expert] for different topics
[should be anonymous]**

  commands such as ls, cp, mv, pwd, find, setenv, which, ...
- Differences between compiled language and interpreted
